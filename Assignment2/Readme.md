# Assignment 2: VHDL Test Bench

***Task:***

1. Develop a test bench for a design in VHDL 
2. Add a comment citing the source
3. Run GHDL to generate a VCD file
4. Use GTKWave to view the VCD file and take a screen shot
5. Upload the design, test bench, and VCD files to the GitHub repository
6. Create a README.md to include the screen shot
 

Program Outcome 2: (Design)

2.5 The student will be able to write test vectors for a digital system and develop a VHDL test-bench to apply these vectors using file based input/output operations.

## VHDL Model

I chose an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for Assignment 2 which takes in two 1 byte inputs, an arithmetic selection and a 1 byte output.
